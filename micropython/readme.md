#Micropython code for pycom LoPy with attached CoZIR CO2, Humidity and Temperature sensor

To use this code you need:
- a LoPy board, expansion board, CoZIR-AH sensor, attached LoRa antenna (make sure: no antenna = fried LoRa chip)
- the pymakr plugin (for Atom or other editor)

The hardware setup is in ../hardware
